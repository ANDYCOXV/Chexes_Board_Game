=================

Wings 3D is required to open and view the 3D models. --> http://www.wings3d.com/
Wings 3D is a free open source cross platform software that can be used for both private and commercial projects.
Wings 3D can be used to export the 3D models to different file formats as well.

It is important to note that the models in Wings 3D do not have a physical unit of measurement.
In turn different file formats and software may consider a unit in Wings 3D to be in millimeters or in miles.
I have made every model using one Wings 3D unit of measurement to represent one centimeter.

If Wings 3D cannot be installed PNG images of the 3D models can be found in the directory labeled "Images".
