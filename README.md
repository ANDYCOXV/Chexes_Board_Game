# Chexes_Board_Game
This is a board game (3d models and instructions) that I have designed and it is a hybrid of checkers and chess that is played on a 4x4 board. I made this board game back in Junior High as a project for wood shop. I thought it was unique and many of my friends and others enjoyed playing the game. I even got a couple of friends together to make the boards and pieces, we mannaged to sell 1 set for $10. Intructions on how to play the game are inculded in the pdf named Chexes Instruction Manual.pdf. The name Chexes comes fromthe first three letters of checkers and chess and the -xes comes from the state where I made it in Texas, but instead of -xas I chose -xes to keep with the "a" less names in checkers and chess.
