# Chexes_Board_Game
This is a board game (3d models and instructions) that I have designed and it is a hybrid of checkers and chess.
The name Chexes comes fromthe first three letters of checkers and chess and the -xes comes from the state where I made it in Texas,
but instead of -xas I chose -xes to keep with the "a" less names in checkers and chess.
